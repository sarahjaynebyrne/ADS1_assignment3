# ADS1_assignment3

TITLE OF PROJECT = nalysing the Relationship between the Human Development Index and Mortality Rates within countries.

This assignment was conducted using a dataset from World Bank the website link -> https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SH.DYN.MORT.

I have focused on exploring statistics, predictive trends and clustering within a dataset as well as merging several datasets for further visualisation. 

The primary aim was to cluster the mortality rate dataset to observe countries with similar results.  

The secondary aim was to apply several predictive models (lines of best-fit) to analyse the best-fit for the 
Human Development Index of countries in 2019 and their respective mortality rates in 2019. 
Additionally, the study applied this predictive model to two further years; 2000 and 2017 to analyse the residuals
to see if it remained to be a best-fit and could be used to predict future mortality rates based off of countries 
Human Development Index.

Applying PEP-8 guidelines to my code.

This project used the following modules:

- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- numpy
- scipy.stats


This repository contains 4 branches:

- main branch -> contains the final version of code and PDF A4 pager
- figures (jpeg format) -> contains the figures the code produces
- code -> older versions of the code as proof that the code improved overtime (hopefully ;) )
- datasets -> the datasets used in the code (csv format) to use yourself :)

NB: code also contains Object-Oriented Programming for that extra mark :)
